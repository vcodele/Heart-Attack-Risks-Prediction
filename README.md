#### HEART ATTACK
## OVERVIEW
The HEART is a muscular organ primarily involved in the transfer of blood to the body. Blood containing oxygen and nutrients pass through the blood vessels to other parts of the body keeping them alive and healthy while carbon dioxide leaves the organs passing through the vessels to the lungs.
Heart Attack occur as a result of blockage in the flow of blood to the heart. This blockage can be partial or total thereby limiting the transfer of blood to the organs of the body or other parts of the heart.
Fat and cholesterol buildup forming plaques are directly involved in causing heart attack. Plaques are formed as a result of deposit of fats and cholesterol buildup. Heart Attack occur when the plaques rupture, this leads to formation of blood clots which can block the passage of blood.
Symptoms of heart attack varies from patients who show severe symptoms, some show mild symptoms to those who donâ€™t show symptoms at all. Symptoms include pressure or tightness in the chest thereby leading to pain, the pain can extend to other areas including the neck, shoulder, arm, jaw and teeth. Other symptoms include nausea, lightheaded, difficulty breathing and fatigue.
Factors that influence the risk to this condition include age (men who are 45 or older have high risk than those younger while women who are 55 and above are at risk than those younger), tobacco, high blood pressure (which can damage the arteries), obesity, diabetes and genetic.

## INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM AND STATING THE OBJECTIVES
Heart Attack as we have explained above present with symptoms in some and not in others, either of which case may be critical. The aim of this project is to predict the occurrence of heart attack in individuals who present some risk factors or who have genetic root.
The project focus on gathering data associated with the diagnosis of heart attack. Examples of which include diabetes, blood pressure, age, obesity and so on.
This will be of help in diagnosis as practitioners will know the level of risk an individual pose which can influence the prevention of the attack.
